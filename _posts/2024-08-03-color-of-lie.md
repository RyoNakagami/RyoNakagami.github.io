## Different Colors of lie

Lie us a way of deceiving someone. It is known that humans start telling lies from around the age of two to three, and this tendency peaks around the age of seven. Interestingly, from then on, the tendency to lie decreases continuously until the age of sixteen. So basically, the teenager years are the most honest of period of development.

This raises a question: What changes between teenagers and adults, and why do they start lying more again?
One theory involves moral licensing, where adults come up with all sorts of ways to rationalize the lies they tell.

Moral licensing is a social psychological concept that describes how individuals tend to justify their behaviors, particularly those that may be considered immoral or unethical. In simpler terms, it's the idea that doing something good can make people feel licensed or entitled to do something not-so-good.

When it comes to lying, it's important to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable lies to understand when and why lying occurs.
