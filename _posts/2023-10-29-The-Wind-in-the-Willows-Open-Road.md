## Chapter 2: The Open Road

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

“I don’t know that I think so very much of that little song, Rat,” observed the Mole cautiously.
He was no poet himself and didn’t care who knew it; and he had a candid nature.

</div>

> not...I think so very much of

This phrase suggests that the Mole does not hold the song in high regard or doesn't have a particularly strong positive opinion about it. 
He may find the song unimpressive or not particularly noteworthy.

> He was no poet himself

This part of the sentence states that the person in question is not a poet. 
In other words, they don't possess the skills or qualities typically associated with being a poet, such as the ability to write poetry.

> and he had a candid nature

This part of the sentence tells us that this person is candid. A candid person is someone who is honest, straightforward, and open in their communication. They don't hide their thoughts or feelings and are known for their sincerity.


<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

I was just going to send a boat down the river for you, Ratty, with strict orders that you were to be fetched up here at once, whatever you were doing

</div>


> with strict orders that you were to be fetched up here at once

Toad intended to issue unequivocal and authoritative instructions, specifying that Ratty should be promptly returned to this location.


<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

“There you are!” cried the Toad, straddling and expanding himself.

</div>

"Straddling" means that he's standing or sitting with his legs apart, possibly in a stance that suggests readiness or excitement. "Expanding himself" suggests that he's inflating or making himself appear larger, which can be a physical or metaphorical expression of enthusiasm or delight.

you’ll find that nothing whatever has been forgotten

</div>

The sentence "you'll find that nothing whatever has been forgotten" means that everything 
has been remembered or accounted for. It indicates that no important details or information 
have been left out or overlooked. This sentence is often used to assure someone that they have 
been thorough and comprehensive in their actions or in their recollection of information. 
It implies a sense of completeness and attentiveness to detail.

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

I’m going to make an animal of you,

</div>

It likely means that the Toad intends to transform or change the person they're addressing in a significant way, possibly in terms of behavior or characteristics.

To put it differently,

- I'm going to help you become a better person.
- I'm here to refine your character.


<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

Disregarding the Rat, he proceeded to play upon the inexperienced Mole as on a harp. Naturally a voluble animal, and always mastered by his imagination, he painted the prospects of the trip and the joys of the open life and the roadside in such glowing colours that the Mole could hardly sit in his chair for excitement. 

</div>

> he proceeded to play upon the inexperienced Mole as on a harp

The Toad is skillfully and persuasively talking to the Mole, as if he were playing a musical instrument, to manipulate or influence the Mole's feelings and thoughts.

> Naturally a voluble animal, and always mastered by his imagination

This describes the Mole as someone who is naturally talkative and easily captivated by his own imagination.
That's why the Mole is so enthusiastic and thrilled by the upcoming jorney that he's finding it hard to remain seated; he's very excited.


<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

the now triumphant Toad led his companions to the paddock and set them to capture the old grey horse, who, without having been consulted, and to his own extreme annoyance, had been told off by Toad for the dustiest job in this dusty expedition. He frankly preferred the paddock, and took a deal of catching.

</div>

> the now triumphant Toad led his companions to the paddock

Toad, who is feeling very proud and victorious because he has successfully organized this expedition, 
takes the lead and guides his friends to a paddock. 
A paddock is an enclosed area where animals are kept, often for grazing.

> set them to capture the old grey horse, who, without having been consulted, and to his own extreme annoyance, had been told off by Toad for the dustiest job in this dusty expedition.

Toad instructs his friends to catch an old grey horse. It seems like this horse is part of their plans for the expedition.
The horse was not asked for his opinion, and he is very annoyed by the task Toad assigned to him, which involves dust and is not pleasant.

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

They drew up on a remote common far from habitations, turned the horse loose to graze, 
and ate their simple supper sitting on the grass by the side of the cart.

</div>

The group of animals, led by Toad, stops their cart on a remote or isolated area of common land. 
"Common" often refers to open land, typically used for grazing by animals, that is publicly accessible. It is far away from any houses or human habitations.


<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

Only this time the two guests took care that Toad should do his fair share of work. In consequence, when the time came for starting next morning, Toad was by no means so rapturous about the simplicity of the primitive life, and indeed attempted to resume his place in his bunk, whence he was hauled by force.

</div>

> only this time the two guests took care that Toad should do his fair share of work"

Toad's two companions (the two guests) made sure that Toad was actively involved in the work 
and responsibilities of the journey, unlike the previous day when he may have avoided work.

> In consequence, when the time came for starting next morning, Toad was by no means so rapturous about the simplicity of the primitive life

Because Toad was made to work and contribute to their journey, he wasn't as enthusiastic or delighted as he was earlier about the simple and primitive lifestyle they were experiencing.

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

Glancing back, they saw a small cloud of dust, with a dark centre of energy, advancing on them at incredible speed, while from out the dust a faint “Poop-poop!” wailed like an uneasy animal in pain. Hardly regarding it, they turned to resume their conversation, when in an instant (as it seemed) the peaceful scene was changed, and with a blast of wind and a whirl of sound that made them jump for the nearest ditch.

</div>

From within the dust cloud, they heard a faint, repeated sound that went "Poop-poop!"
Initially, Toad and his companions didn't pay much attention to the approaching dust cloud and the strange sound. They were about to continue their conversation.

But suddenly and seemingly out of nowhere, the peaceful and calm scene they were in was disrupted. 
There was a strong gust of wind and a swirling noise that startled them, causing them to quickly jump into the nearest roadside ditch, likely to seek shelter or protection.


## Words and phrases

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>
<p class="h4"><ins>Def: taken up with</ins></p>

"taken up with" is an idiomatic expression that means someone is deeply engrossed or preoccupied with something.

The sentence depicts Toad's joyful reaction upon finding someone or something, with his actions suggesting he's quite excited and animated at that moment.

</div>

When someone is "taken up" with a particular activity, idea, or subject, it implies that they are giving it a lot of their attention and time, often to the point of being fully absorbed by it.

For example, if someone is "very taken up with a new hobby," it means they are completely immersed in that hobby and it is occupying a significant portion of their thoughts and time.
