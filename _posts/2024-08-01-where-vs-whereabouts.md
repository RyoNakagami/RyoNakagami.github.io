## Phrase: Whereabouts are you?

Ive just come arross the phrase, "whereabouts int the world are you?", when listing to
[Why do we lie? - CrowdScience podcast, BBC World Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LCgem1OAcE&t=416s).

- Interviewer: whereabouts in the world are you?
- Interviewee: I am in West Virgina Charleston in the United States.

When I heard of this conversation, one questions come up in my mind, whats the difference 
between "whereabouts are you?" and simply asking "where are you"?


###  where are you?" and "whereabouts are you?"

The primary difference between the phrases "whereabouts are you?" and "simply asking "where are you?" lies in the level of specificity and the implied intent behind the question. In general, "whereabouts are you?" focuses on the general area or vicinity, while "where are you?" demands a more detailed and pinpoint location.

- This phrase suggests a request for a more general or approximate location. It indicates a desire to understand the speaker's or writer's broad vicinity or region. For example, answering "I'm in the city center" or "I'm in the suburbs" would suffice.
- "Whereabouts" is often used when the exact address or precise location is not the primary concern. It can be useful when trying to establish a person's proximity to a particular area or when gauging their general surroundings.

- This question typically seeks a more specific and precise location. It implies a need or desire for an exact address, landmark, or geographical coordinates. For instance, an appropriate response might be "I'm at 123 Main Street" or "I'm near the town hall."
- "Where are you?" is often used in situations where knowing the exact location is crucial, such as providing directions, arranging a meeting point, or coordinating emergency services.
