## Overthink

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#D3D3D3; background-color:#F8F8F8'>
<p class="h4"><ins>Def: Overthink</ins></p>

- to think too much about (something)
- to put too much time into thinking about or analyzing (something) in a way that is more harmful than helpful

Also, you could say someone who tends to overthink is overthinker

</div>

- overthink a situation/problem
- I was a terrible actor when I went to New York. I was scared. I would overprepare, sometimes overthink a role.
- But the problem is I'm an overthinker. I contemplate and consider, deliberate and debate things small and large in my life. Simple things become complicated and easy decisions become complex.

### Usage example

When dealing with complex data science problems, it's crucial to avoid overthinking and focus on extracting meaningful insights. Overthinking in this context may involve unnecessary intricacies in the model, excessive feature engineering without clear justification, or the incorporation of overly complex algorithms that do not substantially improve predictive performance. Striking a balance between thorough analysis and practical simplicity is essential for effective and interpretable data science outcomes.


## Do overthinkers experience greater challenges with the isolation of remote work?

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

Some experts say remote work can make overthinking tendencies worse, because the lack of face-to-face 
communication among colleagues increases ambiguity and uncertainty â€“ factors that can trigger overthinking spirals. 

Is this statement true?

### What kind of people are overthinkers?

Overthinkers tend to be super conscientious people, they tend to be highly 
responsible individuals and they tend to be a little perfectionistic.

Overthinkers can be a boon to the workplace, because they're diligent, 
hard-working and aware of others' feelings. But once anxiety takes hold, those 
strengths can become weaknesses too.

when overthinkers start to worry, they tend to take one of two paths: 

- they either disengage from the situation, or
- over-engage and constantly seek reassurance that their fear is unfounded

### remote-work and overthinkers

Some experts thinks that overthinkers might be struggling the most in the remote-work era, 
since they rely a lot on body language cues.

In a physical workplace, they could be sitting across from a colleague, 
noticing their sour expression and worrying that it relates to them, or worrying that they're working harder than they are.
But as the workforce moved from in-office to remote during the pandemic, overthinkers lost many of the little things that could quell their worries.
