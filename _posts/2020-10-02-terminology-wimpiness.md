## When Did I come across the word, wimpiness?

In the early days of UNIX, the computer that UNIX ran on was a PDP11.
It was a machine that had very little computing power. It didn't run very fast.
It also didn't have very much memory.

That meant that a lot of the software that was in early dats of UNIX tended to be 
fairly simple and straightforward. That reflected not only the sort of the relative 
`wimpiness` of the hardware but also the personal tastes of the people doing the work.

In a hardware context, "wimpiness" refers to the lack of power, performance, or 
capability of a device or component. It suggests that the hardware is 
underpowered or unable to handle demanding tasks efficiently. 

A "wimpy" hardware may struggle to execute resource-intensive operations, exhibit slow processing speeds, or have limited memory or storage capacity. It implies that the hardware may not be suitable for high-performance applications or may not meet the requirements of certain tasks.

In contrast, robust hardware is typically characterized by its ability to handle demanding workloads, deliver high processing power, and provide ample resources for smooth and efficient operation.


> Wimpiness in programming context

In programming context, "wimpiness" refers to a code or program that lacks robustness, resilience, or the ability to handle errors and unexpected situations effectively. It implies that the code is fragile, easily broken, or prone to errors. A "wimpy" program may crash or produce incorrect results when faced with unexpected inputs, edge cases, or exceptions. It suggests a lack of defensive programming practices, such as input validation, error handling, and graceful degradation. Writing code with a "wimpy" approach can lead to unreliable or unstable software that may not perform as expected in various scenarios.
