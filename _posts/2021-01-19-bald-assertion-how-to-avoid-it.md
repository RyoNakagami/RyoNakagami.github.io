## What is Bald assetion?

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#D3D3D3; background-color:#F8F8F8'>
<p class="h4"><ins>Def: Bald assertion</ins></p>

A bald assertion refers to a statement that is made without providing any evidence, 
data, or logical reasoning to support it. It is essentially a claim or assertion that is presented as fact but lacks any substantiation. 

</div>

Here's an example of a bald assertion:

```
Bald Assertion: 
    Company X has the best customer satisfaction ratings 
    in the industry.
```

In this example, the assertion claims that Company X has the best customer 
satisfaction ratings, but it doesn't provide any data, statistics, or information
 to back up this claim. Without evidence, such a statement is not persuasive in a statistical or analytical context.

To make this assertion more valid, one would need to provide statistical data, 
such as customer satisfaction scores, rankings, or a comparison with other 
companies in the same industry, to support the claim. This would transform the 
assertion into a well-supported statement based on data and evidence.
