The phrase "opposites attract" is often used to express the idea that individuals with different personalities, 
interests, or characteristics are often drawn to each other in relationships. 
This concept suggests that people who are dissimilar in certain ways may find each other interesting, complementary, or even mysterious, leading to a strong attraction.

In the context of relationships, this idea can be applied to various aspects, such as personality traits, hobbies, values, or backgrounds. For example, one person may be outgoing while the other is more reserved, or one may have a passion for adventure while the other prefers a quiet and stable lifestyle.

The belief that opposites attract is not universally applicable to all relationships, as people have diverse preferences and priorities. Some individuals may find compatibility and comfort in similarities, sharing common interests and values. Others may thrive on the dynamic tension and excitement that differences can bring to a relationship.

Ultimately, the success of a relationship depends on effective communication, mutual respect, and a shared understanding of each other's needs, regardless of whether partners are similar or different in certain aspects of their personalities or lifestyles.

Imagine a software development team working on a project to create a new mobile application. The team is composed of two developers, Alex and Jordan, who have distinct programming styles and preferences.

Alex is known for favoring functional programming languages and has a background in developing clean and concise code. On the other hand, Jordan has a preference for object-oriented programming languages and tends to prioritize design patterns and robust architecture.

In a team meeting, someone might comment:

"Alex and Jordan are like a perfect example of 'opposites attract' in our development team. Alex's functional programming expertise complements Jordan's object-oriented design skills. While their approaches might seem different at first, the combination of their strengths results in a more resilient and well-rounded codebase for our mobile app."

In this example, the phrase "opposites attract" is used to highlight the beneficial collaboration between two developers with different programming styles. Their diverse approaches, though opposite in some ways, contribute to a more comprehensive and effective solution for the software project.

## Does Opposites really attract?

When it comes to partnerships or romantic relationships, scientists say there’s little truth in the old adage that opposites attract.

One study, which was conducted with 80,000 opposite-sex couples enrolled in the UK Biobank project, showed that couples largely matched across a range of traits including political and religious views, levels of education and some measures of IQ. Heavy smokers, heavy drinkers and teetotallers all tended to partner up with people who shared their habits. When opposites did appear to attract, the associations were often weak and uncertain. This was seen in early risers pairing with night owls, left-handed people with right-handed, and those who have a tendency to worry with those who do not.
