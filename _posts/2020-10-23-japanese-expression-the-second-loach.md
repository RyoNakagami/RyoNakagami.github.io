Literally it means "chasing the second loach" in English. This is a figurative expression used to describe someone who is trying to achieve a goal or pursue something further, often after already having some success or experience.

Usage example:

    That athlete has already won one gold medal, but now they are working even harder, like they're chasing the second loach.

It is derived from the expression, "Loaches are not always found under the willow tree".

A person happened to catch loaches under a willow tree by sheer luck, and this turned into a big success.
After that, they started to believe that "loaches are always found under the willow tree." 
They consistently caught loaches under the willow tree, and when others saw this,
they laughed and said, "Loaches are not always found under the willow tree." 

originally it conveys the idea that just because something happened once 
by chance doesn't mean it will always happen that way. It underscores the importance
of not making hasty generalizations based on isolated incidents.
