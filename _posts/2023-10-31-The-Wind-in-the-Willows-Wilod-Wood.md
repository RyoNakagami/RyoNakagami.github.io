But whenever the Mole mentioned his wish to the Water Rat, he always found himself put off.

</div>

It suggests that the Mole has a desire or wish that he communicates to the Water Rat. However, whenever the Mole brings up or mentions this wish to the Water Rat, the Water Rat responds by avoiding the topic or delaying any further discussion about it. In other words, the Water Rat doesn't seem willing to engage in a conversation about the Mole's wish and tends to deflect or postpone the discussion.

> Purple loosestrife

Purple loosestrife is an erect perennial herb standing three to
ten feet tall. Its average height is five feet. The plant blossoms
every July through September with purple flowers that are
located in long spikes at the tip of its branches. 

> whence its own face laughed back at it

Here, personification is used to attribute human qualities to the plant. The phrase suggests that the loosestrife sees its own reflection in the water and metaphorically perceives it as a laughing face, adding a playful or whimsical touch to the description.
