## What is The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame? 

"The Wind in the Willows," authored by the British writer Kenneth Grahame, is a revered classic in the realm of children's literature. 
Originally published in 1908, it has since garnered widespread affection from readers.
Set in the picturesque English countryside, the narrative unfolds around the escapades of a group of anthropomorphic animal characters.

This literary work abounds with whimsical and imaginative tales that possess the remarkable ability to transport readers into a world brimming with wonder and adventure, reminiscent of a child's world. Engaging with these narratives offers adults like us the opportunity to rekindle their inner child, thereby rediscovering a profound sense of joy, curiosity, and imagination.

Every one of us harbors an inner child, and it is incumbent upon us to periodically nurture and reestablish a connection with this aspect of our being.

It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his brush on the floor, 
said, “Bother!” and “O blow!” and also “Hang spring-cleaning!” and bolted out of the house without even waiting to put on his coat.

</div>

> It was small wonder

This phrase suggests that what follows is not surprising or unexpected given the circumstances.

> and bolted out of the house without even waiting to put on his coat

The character then quickly left the house in a hurry, without taking the time to put on a coat. 
This indicates that their frustration with spring cleaning was so great that they needed to escape the situation immediately.

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

The sunshine struck hot on his fur, 
soft breezes caressed his heated brow, 
and after the seclusion of the cellarage he had lived in so long the carol of 
happy birds fell on his dulled hearing almost like a shout.

</div>

> soft breezes caressed his heated brow

The character also feels gentle, warm breezes against their face. 
The use of the word "caressed" suggests a comforting and soothing sensation.

> the carol of happy birds fell on his dulled hearing almost like a shout

As the character emerges from the cellar, they hear the joyful singing of birds. 
This sound is so vivid and cheerful that it almost seems like a loud and exuberant shout to their ears.

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

He[The elderly rabbit at the gap] was bowled over in an instant by the impatient and contemptuous Mole, 
who trotted along the side of the hedge chaffing the other rabbits as they peeped hurriedly from their holes to see what the row was about. 

</div>

> He was bowled over in an instant by the impatient and contemptuous Mole

"bowl sb over" means to surprise or impress sb a lot. 
The elderly rabbit at the gap was taken by surprise or startled, and the cause of this surprise is the Mole.

"contemptuous" means feeling or showing that you have no respect for sth/sb.

"the impatient and contemptuous Mole" means that he is not willing to wait and does not care what the rabbit said

> chaffing the other rabbits as they peeped hurriedly from their holes to see what the row was about

The Mole is interacting with other rabbits who were cautiously emerging from their burrows (holes) to observe what was happening. The term "chaffing" suggests that the Mole is perhaps playfully teasing or joking with these rabbits, possibly in a lighthearted or cheeky manner.


<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

It all seemed too good to be true. Hither and thither through the meadows he rambled busily, 
along the hedgerows, across the copses, finding everywhere birds building, flowers budding, leaves thrusting ⁠——everything happy, and progressive, and occupied. 

</div>

> It all seemed too good to be true

This suggests that the Mole is finding their current experience so 
wonderful that it almost feels like it's too perfect or unbelievable.

> Hither and thither through the meadows he rambled busily

The Mole is moving around energetically and with a sense of purpose, exploring meadows and their surroundings.

"Hither and thither" means in various directions, especially in a disorganized way.
For example, 

- the entire household ran hither and thither
- people began rushingh hither and thither

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

And instead of having an uneasy conscience pricking him and whispering “whitewash!” 
he somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog among all these busy citizens. 
After all, the best part of a holiday is perhaps not so much to be resting yourself, as to see all the other fellows busy working.

</div>

> instead of having an uneasy conscience pricking him 

This implies that the character no longer feels guilty or conflicted about something.

The phrase "your conscience pricks you" means to make you feel guilty about sth. For example, 

- Her conscience pricks you as she lied to her sister

> After all, the best part of a holiday is perhaps not so much to be resting yourself, as to see all the other fellows busy working.

This passage concludes by suggesting that, during a holiday or leisure time, 
the true joy may not necessarily be in resting oneself but in witnessing the industry and activity of others.


<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

He[The Mole] thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river.

Never in his life had he seen a river before⁠ —this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, 
chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, 
to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again

</div>

> when, as he meandered aimlessly along

This part sets the scene. The person was walking or moving around in a relaxed 
and wandering manner, without a specific destination or purpose. They were 
simply strolling or moving without a clear direction.

> this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal

Here, the river is metaphorically described as an "animal" to emphasize its dynamic and living nature. 
It's compared to an animal that is sleek, sinuous (gracefully winding or curving), and full-bodied (robust and full of life).


<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

Believe me, my young friend, there is nothing⁠—absolute nothing⁠—half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats. 

</div>

> Believe me, my young friend

The speaker is addressing a young person and attempting to convey the importance of 
what they are about to say. This introduction suggests that the speaker is about to share some wisdom or personal insight.


> there is nothing⁠—absolute nothing⁠—half so much worth doing

The speaker is emphasizing that, in their opinion, there is nothing else that comes close to being as valuable or enjoyable as the activity they are about to describe. The use of "absolute nothing" underscores the idea that this activity is unparalleled.

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

Green turf sloped down to either edge, brown snaky tree-roots gleamed below the surface of the quiet water, while ahead of them the silvery shoulder and foamy tumble of a weir, arm-in-arm with a restless dripping mill-wheel, that held up in its turn a grey-gabled mill-house, filled the air with a soothing murmur of sound, dull and smothery, yet with little clear voices speaking up cheerfully out of it at intervals.

</div>


> Green turf sloped down to either edge

The scene is set with green grass or turf gently sloping toward the water on both sides. This creates a smooth transition between land and water.

> ahead of them the silvery shoulder and foamy tumble of a weir

In the distance, there is a weir, which is a low dam or barrier built across a river to control the flow of water. The weir is described as having a "silvery shoulder" and "foamy tumble," indicating that the water cascades over it in a picturesque manner.

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

“Greedy beggars!” he[The Otter] observed, making for the provender. “Why didn’t you invite me, Ratty?”

</div>

> "Greedy beggars!"

This exclamation is used to playfully chide or tease someone for their behavior. It suggests that the speaker is surprised or amused by what they see or hear, but it's not meant to be taken seriously.

> "making for the provender":

The character is moving towards or reaching for the food or provisions. This suggests that the character is interested in joining in and partaking in the eating.



<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

Once, it was nothing but sailing,” said the Rat. “Then he tired of that and took to punting. Nothing would please him but to punt all day and every day, and a nice mess he made of it. Last year it was houseboating, and we all had to go and stay with him in his houseboat, and pretend we liked it. He was going to spend the rest of his life in a houseboat. It’s all the same, whatever he takes up; he gets tired of it, and starts on something fresh.

</div>

> Once, it was nothing but sailing

The sentence starts by indicating that at one point, the Toad was solely interested in sailing. This was their primary hobby or passion.

> It's all the same, whatever he takes up; he gets tired of it, and starts on something fresh

 This sentence summarizes the Toad's pattern of behavior. He tends to become deeply interested in a new hobby or activity, 
 pursue it intensively, and then eventually grow tired of it. This leads him to move on to something entirely different.


## What is animal-etiquette?

"Animal-etiquette" refers to the understood or accepted social rules 
and customs among animals in the story's world. The use of "animal-etiquette" 
suggests that animals in this context have a code of conduct or behavior that they follow.

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

The Mole knew well that it is quite against animal-etiquette to dwell on possible trouble ahead, or even to allude to it; so he dropped the subject.

</div>

The sentence conveys that the Mole is aware of this etiquette or set of unwritten rules. According to this animal-etiquette, it is considered impolite or inappropriate to focus on or discuss potential problems or troubles that may lie ahead. It is implied that animals in this world prefer not to dwell on negative possibilities and instead maintain a more positive and optimistic outlook.


<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>

The Mole recollected that animal-etiquette forbade any sort of comment on the sudden disappearance of one’s friends at any moment, for any reason or no reason whatever.

</div>

The sentence specifies that according to this animal-etiquette, it is considered impolite or socially 
inappropriate to make any kind of comment or remark about the sudden disappearance of one's friends, 
regardless of when, why, or under what circumstances they disappear. 

This suggests that acknowledging or discussing the unexplained absence of a friend is discouraged, and perhaps even seen as a breach of etiquette.

The Mole is aware of these rules and follows them by not making any comment about the disappearance of friends, even if it may seem strange or sudden.
