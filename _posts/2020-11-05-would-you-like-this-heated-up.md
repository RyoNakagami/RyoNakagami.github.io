## Phrase: Would you like this heated up?

When I went to the convenience store in Japan, 
a staff member often asks me "こちらの商品温めますか"? 


"こちらの商品温めますか" means "would you like this heated up?".


When a staff member at a convenience store in Japan asks if you would like something heated up, they are offering to warm or heat the item for you.
This is a common service in Japanese convenience stores, especially for certain food items like pre-packaged buns, fried foods, or even beverages. 
It's a way to make the food more enjoyable. 
If you accept their offer, they will typically use a microwave or other heating equipment to warm the item for you. 
It's a convenient way to enjoy hot or warm snacks on the go.

To decline the offer to have your item heated up politely in a Japanese convenience store, 
you can use a polite and simple phrase like

- 大丈夫です(Daijoubu desu): "No, thank you." or "I'm fine, thank you."

You can say this with a smile and a polite bow to convey your gratitude for the offer while declining it.
