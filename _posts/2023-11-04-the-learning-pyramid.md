- If you just listen to something, you will retain 5% of it 
- If you read it, you double what you get by listening, so you will retain 10% of it 
- If you listen and read it, you will retain 20%
- If you demonstrate it like podcasting or makeing a lead speach, you will retain 30%
- If you disscuss how you learned, you will retain 50%
- If you practice by doing and apply the knowledge, you will retain 75%
- If you take that skill-set and then you go and teach somebody, you will retain 90%

xychart-beta
    title "The Learning Curve"

    y-axis "kowledge level (%)" 0 --> 100
    bar [5, 10, 20 , 30 , 50, 75, 90]
```

`Mermaid 10.6.1` ではこれが今では精一...
