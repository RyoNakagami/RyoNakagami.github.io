## dire

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#e6e6fa; background-color:#e6e6fa'>
<p class="h4"><ins>Def: dire</ins></p>

It is a formal word, meaning very serious:

- Such action may have dire consequences
- We're in dire need of your help
- The firm is in dire straits and may go bankrupt.
- The paper suggests that the economic consequences of population ageing will be less dire than estimates based on cohort structure.

</div>

"Dire" is an adjective that typically describes a situation or condition that is 
extremely serious, urgent, or severe. It conveys a sense of grave concern or urgency.
It is often used in  a qualitative sense.

You might hear someone say that a company's data quality is in a "dire" state, meaning that 
the quality of the data is so poor that it is having a severe negative impact on their operations or analytical efforts. 

Similarly, someone might describe the need for a certain data-driven solution as "dire" 
if it's urgently required to address a critical business problem.

## Proxy (verb)

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#D3D3D3; background-color:#F8F8F8'>
<p class="h4"><ins>Def: proxy (verb)</ins></p>

The verb "proxy" is used to describe a method or approach that is used to estimate 
or represent something when direct measurement or observation of that thing is difficult, time-consuming, or not feasible. 

It means almost same as 

```
proxy yyy by xxx
use xxx as a proxy of yyy
```

</div>

Suppose we have the following sentence:

```
These studies and many others proxy population aging by the population share 
aged 60 (or 65) and over.
```

Here, the studies are using a proxy measure to estimate or represent population aging. 
Instead of directly measuring all aspects of population aging, such as health status, 
retirement rates, or other demographic indicators, they are using the population share 
of people aged 60 or 65 and over as a proxy.


## Prioritize (verb)

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#D3D3D3; background-color:#F8F8F8'>
<p class="h4"><ins>Def: Prioritize (verb)</ins></p>

- to treat somthing as being more important than other things
- to put tasks or problems in order of importance

</div>

```
Do you prioritize freedom of speech over High speech?
It's a complex issue, and the approach may vary depending on the specific context, 
but we must always prioritize the well-being and safety of our communities alongside 
the value of open discourse."
```

## Phrase: we only have a certain amount of time

<div style='padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em; border-radius: 1em; border-style:solid; border-color:#D3D3D3; background-color:#F8F8F8'>
<p class="h4"><ins>Def: we only have a certain amount of time</ins></p>

Basically it means "we have a limited amount of time"

</div>

This phrase is often used to encourage people to prioritize their tasks or problems, 
as well as to focus on what truly matters to them, rather than wasting time on unimportant or trivial matters.
